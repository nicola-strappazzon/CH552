# ADC

This is a simple example of the ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) that uses the AIN0 port, which is equivalent to P1.1, to obtain a voltage that is varied by a potentiometer. The values are printed through [CDC](https://github.com/nstrappazzonc/CH552/tree/main/src/cdc) and range from 0 to 255.
